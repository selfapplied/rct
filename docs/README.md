## Key Research: Quantum Clock

The **antclock research** (quantum biological clocks) represents a major finding within the RCT framework:

### What is it?
Biological systems possess intrinsic quantum clocks that govern optimal timing for medical interventions, drug administration, and healing processes.

### Where to learn more?
1. **Quick overview**: `ANTCLOCK_RESEARCH_SUMMARY.md` (5 min read)
2. **Detailed summary**: `quantum_clock_research.md` (15 min read)
3. **Full theory**: `paper/quantum_medicine.md` Section 4.4 (30+ min read)

### Key findings:
- Internal quantum clocks align treatment with optimal receptivity windows
- Circadian patterns reflect quantum orbital dynamics
- Temporal phase matching improves treatment effectiveness
- Implementation exists in `src/contracts/temporal.py`
