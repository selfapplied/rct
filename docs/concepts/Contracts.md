## What is a Contract?

In Recursive Contract Theory, a **contract** is an agreement between an agent and reality about how meaning is formed. It's a self-enforcing relationship that:

1. Acknowledges the present state
2. Acts to maintain or improve coherence
3. Updates itself based on the results

## Technical Definition

From a mathematical perspective, contracts are fixed point combinators that operate on a manifold space for an energy E. The total energy remains fixed between iterations, or convolutions, or aims to by capturing energy differences between states. No model is perfect, and it's okay to drop information because it will find its way back to you from the void.
